Other Credits
--
This game was originally written for assignment-0 of GD50. Too bad I never really took that course.
Anyways thanks to the course head Colton Ogden and entire CS50 team for uploading the videos from which i learnt a lot.

Special thanks to author Seth Kenlon for his book "Developing Games on Rasperry Pi" from which I began my Lua and Love2D programming
And special thanks to the person who is reading this. Feel free to use any or all of my scripts for your personal/commercial projects
